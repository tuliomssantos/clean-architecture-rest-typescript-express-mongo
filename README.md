#   Clean Architecture Restful API - Typescript - Express - MongoDB

This implementation is an example of how to implement an rest api following the principles of Clean Architecture through a simple CRUD.

In this example I used typescript, express and mongodb, however, use cases and entities do not depend on these tools and in this way they could be easily replaced.

Contributions, suggestions and corrections are very welcome!
